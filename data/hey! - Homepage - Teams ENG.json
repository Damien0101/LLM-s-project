technical error in OMGT/NAME => important, we must avoid this.

4) Churn - What if the customer wants to leave hey! ?

It is very important to apply a Retention approach to customers who want to leave us and make them feel that they are
important to us.

We don't have a Churn Promo Toolkit, but we can offer a lot of solutions in case the customer wants to leave us.

Don't hesitate to do the comparison with the other operator.

Ask them why they want to cancel their subscription:
For example:
- "I'm sorry to read that you want to leave us :-( Would you share with us your experience or problem please?"

- "I'm sorry to read that you want to leave us :-( Would you give us some more information please?"
We can always suggest solutions such as Billshock or a correction of the bill (if necessary)...
If the customer still does not agree => Forward the link to the customer to cancel their subscription via the website.

Link : https://www.heytelecom.be/nl/hulp-en-support/mijn-internetdienst/verhuizing/hoe-zegt-je-je-abonnement-op

IMPORTANT :

-Inform the customer that hey! does NOT have a Prepaid offer!

-Inform the customer that he will lose his number if we cancel his number.

-If the customer is interested in another Operator, he has to contact the concerned operator himself.

If the customer asks to churn via our Chatbot, the Bot will redirect him to the webform.

Exceptionally: If the customer contacts us because he/she informs us that he/she has received
an error message on the hey! website for the churn request, please proceed as follows:

= Ask to share the error message via chat or SoMed

= Ask for the reason of the cancellation request (if interesting feedback to share with your TL)

= Do a full ID check with the customer before processing their request

= Create a Churn case with the right Product + process the churn request in SF + close the case

= Add the case number in the conversation in ‘internal note’.
